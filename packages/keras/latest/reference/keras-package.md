R interface to Keras




## Description

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, developed with a focus on enabling
fast experimentation. Keras has the following key features:






## Details



*  Allows the same code to run on CPU or on GPU, seamlessly.

*  User-friendly API which makes it easy to quickly prototype deep learning models.

*  Built-in support for convolutional networks (for computer vision), recurrent
networks (for sequence processing), and any combination of both.

*  Supports arbitrary network architectures: multi-input or multi-output models,
layer sharing, model sharing, etc. This means that Keras is appropriate for
building essentially any deep learning model, from a memory network to a neural
Turing machine.

*  Is capable of running on top of multiple back-ends including

https://github.com/Microsoft/cntkCNTK,
or https://github.com/Theano/TheanoTheano.
