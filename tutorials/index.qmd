## For beginers

The best place to start is with the user-friendly Keras sequential API. Build models by plugging together building blocks. After these tutorials, read the [Keras guide](guides/keras/sequential_model.qmd).

## For experts

The Keras functional and subclassing APIs provide a define-by-run interface for customization and advanced research. Build your model, then write the forward and backward pass. Create custom layers, activations, and training loops.
