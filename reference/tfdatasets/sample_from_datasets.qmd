# sample_from_datasets

## Samples elements at random from the datasets in `datasets`.

## Description
Samples elements at random from the datasets in `datasets`. 


## Usage
```r
sample_from_datasets( 
  datasets, 
  weights = NULL, 
  seed = NULL, 
  stop_on_empty_dataset = TRUE 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| datasets | A list ofobjects with compatible structure. |
| weights | (Optional.) A list of `length(datasets)` floating-point values where `weights[[i]]` represents the probability with which an element should be sampled from `datasets[[i]]`, or a dataset object where each element is such a list. Defaults to a uniform distribution across `datasets`. |
| seed | (Optional.) An integer, representing the random seed that will be used to create the distribution. |
| stop_on_empty_dataset | If `TRUE`, selection stops if it encounters an empty dataset. If `FALSE`, it skips empty datasets. It is recommended to set it to `TRUE`. Otherwise, the selected elements start off as the user intends, but may change as input datasets become empty. This can be difficult to detect since the dataset starts off looking correct. Defaults to `TRUE`. |



## Value
A dataset that interleaves elements from `datasets` at random, according to `weights` if provided, otherwise with uniform probability.
