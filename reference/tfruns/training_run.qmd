# training_run

## Run a training script

## Description
Run a training script 


## Usage
```r
training_run( 
  file = "train.R", 
  context = "local", 
  config = Sys.getenv("R_CONFIG_ACTIVE", unset = "default"), 
  flags = NULL, 
  properties = NULL, 
  run_dir = NULL, 
  artifacts_dir = getwd(), 
  echo = TRUE, 
  view = "auto", 
  envir = parent.frame(), 
  encoding = getOption("encoding") 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| file | Path to training script (defaults to "train.R") |
| context | Run context (defaults to "local") |
| config | The configuration to use. Defaults to the active configuration for the current environment (as specified by the `R_CONFIG_ACTIVE`<br>environment variable), or `default` when unset. |
| flags | Named list with flag values (see `flags()`) or path to YAML file containing flag values. |
| properties | Named character vector with run properties. Properties are additional metadata about the run which will be subsequently available via `ls_runs()`. |
| run_dir | Directory to store run data within |
| artifacts_dir | Directory to capture created and modified files within. Pass `NULL` to not capture any artifcats. |
| echo | Print expressions within training script |
| view | View the results of the run after training. The default "auto" will view the run when executing a top-level (printed) statement in an interactive session. Pass `TRUE` or `FALSE` to control whether the view is shown explictly. You can also pass "save" to save a copy of the run report at `tfruns.d/view.html` |
| envir | The environment in which the script should be evaluated |
| encoding | The encoding of the training script; see `file()`. |

## Details

The training run will by default use a unique new run directory within the "runs" sub-directory of the current working directory (or to the value of the `tfruns.runs_dir` R option if specified). 

The directory name will be a timestamp (in GMT time). If a duplicate name is generated then the function will wait long enough to return a unique one. 

If you want to use an alternate directory to store run data you can either set the global `tfruns.runs_dir` R option, or you can pass a `run_dir`

explicitly to `training_run()`, optionally using the `unique_run_dir()`

function to generate a timestamp-based directory name. 


## Value
Single row data frame with run flags, metrics, etc.
