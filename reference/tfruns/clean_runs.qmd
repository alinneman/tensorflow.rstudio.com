# clean_runs

## Clean run directories

## Description
 Remove run directories from the filesystem. 


## Usage
```r
 
clean_runs( 
  runs = ls_runs(runs_dir = runs_dir), 
  runs_dir = getOption("tfruns.runs_dir", "runs"), 
  confirm = interactive() 
) 
 
purge_runs( 
  runs_dir = getOption("tfruns.runs_dir", "runs"), 
  confirm = interactive() 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| runs | Runs to clean. Can be specified as a data frame (as returned by `ls_runs()`) or as a character vector of run directories. |
| runs_dir | Directory containing runs. Defaults to "runs" beneath the current working directory (or to the value of the `tfruns.runs_dir` R option if specified). |
| confirm | `TRUE` to confirm before performing operation |

## Details
 The `clean_runs()` function moves the specified runs (by default, all runs) into an "archive" subdirectory of the "runs" directory.  The `purge_runs()` function permanently deletes the "archive" subdirectory. 




## Examples
```{r, eval=ecodown::examples_not_run()}
library(tfruns)
 
clean_runs(ls_runs(completed == FALSE)) 
 
 
```
