## TensorFlow for R

## Description
 [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. 




## Details
 The [TensorFlow  API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/all_symbols) is composed of a set of Python modules that enable constructing and executing TensorFlow graphs. The tensorflow package provides access to the complete TensorFlow API from within R.  For additional documentation on the tensorflow package see [https://tensorflow.rstudio.com](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com)
