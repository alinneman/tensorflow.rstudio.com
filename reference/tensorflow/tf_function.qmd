# tf_function

## Creates a callable TensorFlow graph from an R function.

## Description
`tf_function` constructs a callable that executes a TensorFlow graph created by tracing the TensorFlow operations in `f`. This allows the TensorFlow runtime to apply optimizations and exploit parallelism in the computation defined by `f`. 


## Usage
```r
tf_function(f, input_signature = NULL, autograph = TRUE, ...) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| f | the function to be compiled |
| input_signature | A possibly nested sequence of `tf$TensorSpec` objects specifying the shapes and dtypes of the tensors that will be supplied to this function. If `NULL`, a separate function is instantiated for each inferred input signature. If `input_signature` is specified, every input to `f` must be a tensor. |
| autograph | TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE (the default), you can use tensors in R control flow expressions `if`, `while`, `for` and `break` and they will be traced into the tensorflow graph. A guide to getting started and additional details can be found: [here](https://t-kalinowski.github.io/tfautograph/) |
| ... | additional arguments passed on to `tf.function` (vary based on Tensorflow version). See [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function#args_1) for details. |
