# save_model_weights_tf

## Save model weights in the SavedModel format

## Description
Save model weights in the SavedModel format 


## Usage
```r
save_model_weights_tf(object, filepath, overwrite = TRUE) 
load_model_weights_tf( 
  object, 
  filepath, 
  by_name = FALSE, 
  skip_mismatch = FALSE, 
  reshape = FALSE 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| object | Model object to save/load |
| filepath | Path to the file |
| overwrite | Whether to silently overwrite any existing file at the target location |
| by_name | Whether to load weights by name or by topological order. |
| skip_mismatch | Logical, whether to skip loading of layers where there is a mismatch in the number of weights, or a mismatch in the shape of the weight (only valid when `by_name = FALSE`). |
| reshape | Reshape weights to fit the layer when the correct number of values are present but the shape does not match. |

## Details

When saving in TensorFlow format, all objects referenced by the network are saved in the same format as `tf.train.Checkpoint`, including any Layer instances or Optimizer instances assigned to object attributes. For networks constructed from inputs and outputs using `tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)`, Layer instances used by the network are tracked/saved automatically. For user-defined classes which inherit from `tf.keras.Model`, Layer instances must be assigned to object attributes, typically in the constructor. 

See the documentation of `tf.train.Checkpoint` and `tf.keras.Model` for details.
