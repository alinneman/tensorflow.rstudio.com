# layer_conv_1d

## 1D convolution layer (e.g. temporal convolution).

## Description
This layer creates a convolution kernel that is convolved with the layer input over a single spatial (or temporal) dimension to produce a tensor of outputs. If `use_bias` is TRUE, a bias vector is created and added to the outputs. Finally, if `activation` is not `NULL`, it is applied to the outputs as well. When using this layer as the first layer in a model, provide an `input_shape` argument (list of integers or `NULL `, e.g. `(10, 128)` for sequences of 10 vectors of 128-dimensional vectors, or `(NULL, 128)` for variable-length sequences of 128-dimensional vectors. 


## Usage
```r
layer_conv_1d( 
  object, 
  filters, 
  kernel_size, 
  strides = 1L, 
  padding = "valid", 
  data_format = "channels_last", 
  dilation_rate = 1L, 
  groups = 1L, 
  activation = NULL, 
  use_bias = TRUE, 
  kernel_initializer = "glorot_uniform", 
  bias_initializer = "zeros", 
  kernel_regularizer = NULL, 
  bias_regularizer = NULL, 
  activity_regularizer = NULL, 
  kernel_constraint = NULL, 
  bias_constraint = NULL, 
  input_shape = NULL, 
  batch_input_shape = NULL, 
  batch_size = NULL, 
  dtype = NULL, 
  name = NULL, 
  trainable = NULL, 
  weights = NULL 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| object | What to compose the new `Layer` instance with. Typically a Sequential model or a Tensor (e.g., as returned by `layer_input()`). The return value depends on `object`. If `object` is: <br>- missing or `NULL`, the `Layer` instance is returned. <br>- a `Sequential` model, the model with an additional layer is returned. <br>- a Tensor, the output tensor from `layer_instance(object)` is returned.  |
| filters | Integer, the dimensionality of the output space (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution). |
| kernel_size | An integer or list of a single integer, specifying the length of the 1D convolution window. |
| strides | An integer or list of a single integer, specifying the stride length of the convolution. Specifying any stride value != 1 is incompatible with specifying any `dilation_rate` value != 1. |
| padding | One of `"valid"`, `"causal"` or `"same"` (case-insensitive). `"valid"` means "no padding". `"same"` results in padding the input such that the output has the same length as the original input. `"causal"` results in causal (dilated) convolutions, e.g. `output[t]` does not depend on `input[t+1:]`. Useful when modeling temporal data where the model should not violate the temporal order. See [WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio, section 2.1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499). |
| data_format | A string, one of `"channels_last"` (default) or `"channels_first"`. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. `"channels_last"` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, length, channels)` (default format for temporal data in Keras) while `"channels_first"` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, channels, length)`. |
| dilation_rate | an integer or list of a single integer, specifying the dilation rate to use for dilated convolution. Currently, specifying any `dilation_rate` value != 1 is incompatible with specifying any `strides`<br>value != 1. |
| groups | A positive integer specifying the number of groups in which the input is split along the channel axis. Each group is convolved separately with `filters / groups` filters. The output is the concatenation of all the groups results along the channel axis. Input channels and `filters` must both be divisible by `groups`. |
| activation | Activation function to use. If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`). |
| use_bias | Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector. |
| kernel_initializer | Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix. |
| bias_initializer | Initializer for the bias vector. |
| kernel_regularizer | Regularizer function applied to the `kernel`<br>weights matrix. |
| bias_regularizer | Regularizer function applied to the bias vector. |
| activity_regularizer | Regularizer function applied to the output of the layer (its "activation").. |
| kernel_constraint | Constraint function applied to the kernel matrix. |
| bias_constraint | Constraint function applied to the bias vector. |
| input_shape | Dimensionality of the input (integer) not including the samples axis. This argument is required when using this layer as the first layer in a model. |
| batch_input_shape | Shapes, including the batch size. For instance, `batch_input_shape=c(10, 32)` indicates that the expected input will be batches of 10 32-dimensional vectors. `batch_input_shape=list(NULL, 32)`<br>indicates batches of an arbitrary number of 32-dimensional vectors. |
| batch_size | Fixed batch size for layer |
| dtype | The data type expected by the input, as a string (`float32`, `float64`, `int32`...) |
| name | An optional name string for the layer. Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice). It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided. |
| trainable | Whether the layer weights will be updated during training. |
| weights | Initial weights for layer. |


## Section

## Input shape

 3D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, steps, input_dim)`

## Output shape

 3D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, new_steps, filters)` `steps` value might have changed due to padding or strides.
