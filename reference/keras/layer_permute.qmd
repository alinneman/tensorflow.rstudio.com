# layer_permute

## Permute the dimensions of an input according to a given pattern

## Description
Permute the dimensions of an input according to a given pattern 


## Usage
```r
layer_permute( 
  object, 
  dims, 
  input_shape = NULL, 
  batch_input_shape = NULL, 
  batch_size = NULL, 
  dtype = NULL, 
  name = NULL, 
  trainable = NULL, 
  weights = NULL 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| object | What to compose the new `Layer` instance with. Typically a Sequential model or a Tensor (e.g., as returned by `layer_input()`). The return value depends on `object`. If `object` is: <br>- missing or `NULL`, the `Layer` instance is returned. <br>- a `Sequential` model, the model with an additional layer is returned. <br>- a Tensor, the output tensor from `layer_instance(object)` is returned.  |
| dims | List of integers. Permutation pattern, does not include the samples dimension. Indexing starts at 1. For instance, `(2, 1)` permutes the first and second dimension of the input. |
| input_shape | Input shape (list of integers, does not include the samples axis) which is required when using this layer as the first layer in a model. |
| batch_input_shape | Shapes, including the batch size. For instance, `batch_input_shape=c(10, 32)` indicates that the expected input will be batches of 10 32-dimensional vectors. `batch_input_shape=list(NULL, 32)`<br>indicates batches of an arbitrary number of 32-dimensional vectors. |
| batch_size | Fixed batch size for layer |
| dtype | The data type expected by the input, as a string (`float32`, `float64`, `int32`...) |
| name | An optional name string for the layer. Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice). It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided. |
| trainable | Whether the layer weights will be updated during training. |
| weights | Initial weights for layer. |


## Section

## Input and Output Shapes

Input shape: Arbitrary 

Output shape: Same as the input shape, but with the dimensions re-ordered according to the specified pattern. 


## Note
Useful for e.g. connecting RNNs and convnets together.
