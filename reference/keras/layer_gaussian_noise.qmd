# layer_gaussian_noise

## Apply additive zero-centered Gaussian noise.

## Description
This is useful to mitigate overfitting (you could see it as a form of random data augmentation). Gaussian Noise (GS) is a natural choice as corruption process for real valued inputs. As it is a regularization layer, it is only active at training time. 


## Usage
```r
layer_gaussian_noise( 
  object, 
  stddev, 
  input_shape = NULL, 
  batch_input_shape = NULL, 
  batch_size = NULL, 
  dtype = NULL, 
  name = NULL, 
  trainable = NULL, 
  weights = NULL 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| object | What to compose the new `Layer` instance with. Typically a Sequential model or a Tensor (e.g., as returned by `layer_input()`). The return value depends on `object`. If `object` is: <br>- missing or `NULL`, the `Layer` instance is returned. <br>- a `Sequential` model, the model with an additional layer is returned. <br>- a Tensor, the output tensor from `layer_instance(object)` is returned.  |
| stddev | float, standard deviation of the noise distribution. |
| input_shape | Dimensionality of the input (integer) not including the samples axis. This argument is required when using this layer as the first layer in a model. |
| batch_input_shape | Shapes, including the batch size. For instance, `batch_input_shape=c(10, 32)` indicates that the expected input will be batches of 10 32-dimensional vectors. `batch_input_shape=list(NULL, 32)`<br>indicates batches of an arbitrary number of 32-dimensional vectors. |
| batch_size | Fixed batch size for layer |
| dtype | The data type expected by the input, as a string (`float32`, `float64`, `int32`...) |
| name | An optional name string for the layer. Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice). It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided. |
| trainable | Whether the layer weights will be updated during training. |
| weights | Initial weights for layer. |


## Section

## Input shape

 Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape` (list of integers, does not include the samples axis) when using this layer as the first layer in a model. 

## Output shape

 Same shape as input.
