# k_batch_dot

## Batchwise dot product.

## Description

`batch_dot` is used to compute dot product of `x` and `y` when `x` and `y`

are data in batch, i.e. in a shape of `(batch_size)`. `batch_dot` results in a tensor or variable with less dimensions than the input. If the number of dimensions is reduced to 1, we use `expand_dims` to make sure that ndim is at least 2. 


## Usage
```r
k_batch_dot(x, y, axes) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| x | Keras tensor or variable with 2 more more axes. |
| y | Keras tensor or variable with 2 or more axes |
| axes | List of (or single) integer with target dimensions (axis indexes are 1-based). The lengths of `axes[[1]]` and `axes[[2]]` should be the same. |


## Section

## Keras Backend

This function is part of a set of Keras backend functions that enable lower level access to the core operations of the backend tensor engine (e.g. TensorFlow, CNTK, Theano, etc.). 

You can see a list of all available backend functions here: [https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/backend.html#backend-functions](https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/backend.html#backend-functions). 

## Value
A tensor with shape equal to the concatenation of `x`'s shape (less the dimension that was summed over) and `y`'s shape (less the batch dimension and the dimension that was summed over). If the final rank is 1, we reshape it to `(batch_size, 1)`.
