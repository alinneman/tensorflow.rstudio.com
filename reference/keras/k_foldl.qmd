## Keras Backend

   This function is part of a set of Keras backend functions that enable lower level access to the core operations of the backend tensor engine (e.g. TensorFlow, CNTK, Theano, etc.).  You can see a list of all available backend functions here: [https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/backend.html#backend-functions](https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/backend.html#backend-functions). 

## Value
 Tensor with same type and shape as `initializer`.
