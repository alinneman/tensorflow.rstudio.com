# layer_flatten

## Flattens an input

## Description
Flatten a given input, does not affect the batch size. 


## Usage
```r
layer_flatten( 
  object, 
  data_format = NULL, 
  input_shape = NULL, 
  dtype = NULL, 
  name = NULL, 
  trainable = NULL, 
  weights = NULL 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| object | What to compose the new `Layer` instance with. Typically a Sequential model or a Tensor (e.g., as returned by `layer_input()`). The return value depends on `object`. If `object` is: <br>- missing or `NULL`, the `Layer` instance is returned. <br>- a `Sequential` model, the model with an additional layer is returned. <br>- a Tensor, the output tensor from `layer_instance(object)` is returned.  |
| data_format | A string. one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. The purpose of this argument is to preserve weight ordering when switching a model from one data format to another. `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, ..., channels)` while `channels_first` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, channels, ...)`. It defaults to the `image_data_format`<br>value found in your Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`. If you never set it, then it will be "channels_last". |
| input_shape | Input shape (list of integers, does not include the samples axis) which is required when using this layer as the first layer in a model. |
| dtype | The data type expected by the input, as a string (`float32`, `float64`, `int32`...) |
| name | An optional name string for the layer. Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice). It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided. |
| trainable | Whether the layer weights will be updated during training. |
| weights | Initial weights for layer. |
