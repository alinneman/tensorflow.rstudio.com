# layer_cropping_1d

## Cropping layer for 1D input (e.g. temporal sequence).

## Description
It crops along the time dimension (axis 1). 


## Usage
```r
layer_cropping_1d( 
  object, 
  cropping = c(1L, 1L), 
  batch_size = NULL, 
  name = NULL, 
  trainable = NULL, 
  weights = NULL 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| object | What to compose the new `Layer` instance with. Typically a Sequential model or a Tensor (e.g., as returned by `layer_input()`). The return value depends on `object`. If `object` is: <br>- missing or `NULL`, the `Layer` instance is returned. <br>- a `Sequential` model, the model with an additional layer is returned. <br>- a Tensor, the output tensor from `layer_instance(object)` is returned.  |
| cropping | int or list of int (length 2) How many units should be trimmed off at the beginning and end of the cropping dimension (axis 1). If a single int is provided, the same value will be used for both. |
| batch_size | Fixed batch size for layer |
| name | An optional name string for the layer. Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice). It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided. |
| trainable | Whether the layer weights will be updated during training. |
| weights | Initial weights for layer. |
