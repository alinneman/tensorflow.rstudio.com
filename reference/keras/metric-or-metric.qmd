# metric-or-Metric

## metric-or-Metric

## Description
 metric-or-Metric 



## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| y_true | Tensor of true targets. |
| y_pred | Tensor of predicted targets. |
| ... | Passed on to the underlying metric. Used for forwards and backwards compatibility. |
| axis | (Optional) (1-based) Defaults to -1. The dimension along which the metric is computed. |
| name | (Optional) string name of the metric instance. |
| dtype | (Optional) data type of the metric result. |



## Value
 If `y_true` and `y_pred` are missing, a (subclassed) `Metric` instance is returned. The `Metric` object can be passed directly to `compile(metrics = )` or used as a standalone object. See `?Metric` for example usage.  Alternatively, if called with `y_true` and `y_pred` arguments, then the computed case-wise values for the mini-batch are returned directly.
