# layer_conv_3d_transpose

## Transposed 3D convolution layer (sometimes called Deconvolution).

## Description
The need for transposed convolutions generally arises from the desire to use a transformation going in the opposite direction of a normal convolution, i.e., from something that has the shape of the output of some convolution to something that has the shape of its input while maintaining a connectivity pattern that is compatible with said convolution. 


## Usage
```r
layer_conv_3d_transpose( 
  object, 
  filters, 
  kernel_size, 
  strides = c(1, 1, 1), 
  padding = "valid", 
  output_padding = NULL, 
  data_format = NULL, 
  dilation_rate = c(1L, 1L, 1L), 
  activation = NULL, 
  use_bias = TRUE, 
  kernel_initializer = "glorot_uniform", 
  bias_initializer = "zeros", 
  kernel_regularizer = NULL, 
  bias_regularizer = NULL, 
  activity_regularizer = NULL, 
  kernel_constraint = NULL, 
  bias_constraint = NULL, 
  input_shape = NULL, 
  batch_input_shape = NULL, 
  batch_size = NULL, 
  dtype = NULL, 
  name = NULL, 
  trainable = NULL, 
  weights = NULL 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| object | What to compose the new `Layer` instance with. Typically a Sequential model or a Tensor (e.g., as returned by `layer_input()`). The return value depends on `object`. If `object` is: <br>- missing or `NULL`, the `Layer` instance is returned. <br>- a `Sequential` model, the model with an additional layer is returned. <br>- a Tensor, the output tensor from `layer_instance(object)` is returned.  |
| filters | Integer, the dimensionality of the output space (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution). |
| kernel_size | An integer or list of 3 integers, specifying the depth, height, and width of the 3D convolution window. Can be a single integer to specify the same value for all spatial dimensions. |
| strides | An integer or list of 3 integers, specifying the strides of the convolution along the depth, height and width.. Can be a single integer to specify the same value for all spatial dimensions. Specifying any stride value != 1 is incompatible with specifying any `dilation_rate` value != 1. |
| padding | one of `"valid"` or `"same"` (case-insensitive). |
| output_padding | An integer or list of 3 integers, specifying the amount of padding along the depth, height, and width of the output tensor. Can be a single integer to specify the same value for all spatial dimensions. The amount of output padding along a given dimension must be lower than the stride along that same dimension. If set to `NULL` (default), the output shape is inferred. |
| data_format | A string, one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, depth, height, width, channels)` while `channels_first` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, channels, depth, height, width)`. It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`. If you never set it, then it will be "channels_last". |
| dilation_rate | An integer or vector of 3 integers, specifying the dilation rate to use for dilated convolution. Can be a single integer to specify the same value for all spatial dimensions. |
| activation | Activation function to use. If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`). |
| use_bias | Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector. |
| kernel_initializer | Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix. |
| bias_initializer | Initializer for the bias vector. |
| kernel_regularizer | Regularizer function applied to the `kernel`<br>weights matrix, |
| bias_regularizer | Regularizer function applied to the bias vector. |
| activity_regularizer | Regularizer function applied to the output of the layer (its "activation"). |
| kernel_constraint | Constraint function applied to the kernel matrix. |
| bias_constraint | Constraint function applied to the bias vector. |
| input_shape | Dimensionality of the input (integer) not including the samples axis. This argument is required when using this layer as the first layer in a model. |
| batch_input_shape | Shapes, including the batch size. For instance, `batch_input_shape=c(10, 32)` indicates that the expected input will be batches of 10 32-dimensional vectors. `batch_input_shape=list(NULL, 32)`<br>indicates batches of an arbitrary number of 32-dimensional vectors. |
| batch_size | Fixed batch size for layer |
| dtype | The data type expected by the input, as a string (`float32`, `float64`, `int32`...) |
| name | An optional name string for the layer. Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice). It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided. |
| trainable | Whether the layer weights will be updated during training. |
| weights | Initial weights for layer. |

## Details
When using this layer as the first layer in a model, provide the keyword argument `input_shape` (list of integers, does not include the sample axis), e.g. `input_shape = list(128, 128, 128, 3)` for a 128x128x128 volume with 3 channels if `data_format="channels_last"`.
