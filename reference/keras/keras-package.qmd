## R interface to Keras

## Description
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Keras has the following key features: 




## Details

- Allows the same code to run on CPU or on GPU, seamlessly. 

- User-friendly API which makes it easy to quickly prototype deep learning models. 

- Built-in support for convolutional networks (for computer vision), recurrent networks (for sequence processing), and any combination of both. 

- Supports arbitrary network architectures: multi-input or multi-output models, layer sharing, model sharing, etc. This means that Keras is appropriate for building essentially any deep learning model, from a memory network to a neural Turing machine. 

- Is capable of running on top of multiple back-ends including [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/cntk), or [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano). 

See the package website at [https://keras.rstudio.com](https://keras.rstudio.com) for complete documentation.
