# layer_random_translation

## Randomly translate each image during training

## Description
Randomly translate each image during training 


## Usage
```r
layer_random_translation( 
  object, 
  height_factor, 
  width_factor, 
  fill_mode = "reflect", 
  interpolation = "bilinear", 
  seed = NULL, 
  fill_value = 0, 
  ... 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| object | What to compose the new `Layer` instance with. Typically a Sequential model or a Tensor (e.g., as returned by `layer_input()`). The return value depends on `object`. If `object` is: <br>- missing or `NULL`, the `Layer` instance is returned. <br>- a `Sequential` model, the model with an additional layer is returned. <br>- a Tensor, the output tensor from `layer_instance(object)` is returned.  |
| height_factor | a float represented as fraction of value, or a list of size 2 representing lower and upper bound for shifting vertically. A negative value means shifting image up, while a positive value means shifting image down. When represented as a single positive float, this value is used for both the upper and lower bound. For instance, `height_factor = c(-0.2, 0.3)`<br>results in an output shifted by a random amount in the range `[-20%, +30%]`. `height_factor = 0.2` results in an output height shifted by a random amount in the range `[-20%, +20%]`. |
| width_factor | a float represented as fraction of value, or a list of size 2 representing lower and upper bound for shifting horizontally. A negative value means shifting image left, while a positive value means shifting image right. When represented as a single positive float, this value is used for both the upper and lower bound. For instance, `width_factor = c(-0.2, 0.3)` results in an output shifted left by 20%, and shifted right by 30%. `width_factor = 0.2` results in an output height shifted left or right by 20%. |
| fill_mode | Points outside the boundaries of the input are filled according to the given mode (one of `{"constant", "reflect", "wrap", "nearest"}`). <br>- **reflect**: `(d c b a | a b c d | d c b a)` The input is extended by reflecting about the edge of the last pixel. <br>- **constant**: `(k k k k | a b c d | k k k k)` The input is extended by filling all values beyond the edge with the same constant value k = 0. <br>- **wrap**: `(a b c d | a b c d | a b c d)` The input is extended by wrapping around to the opposite edge. <br>- **nearest**: `(a a a a | a b c d | d d d d)` The input is extended by the nearest pixel.  |
| interpolation | Interpolation mode. Supported values: `"nearest"`, `"bilinear"`. |
| seed | Integer. Used to create a random seed. |
| fill_value | a float represents the value to be filled outside the boundaries when `fill_mode="constant"`. |
| ... | standard layer arguments. |
