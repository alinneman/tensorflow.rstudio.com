# layer_masking

## Masks a sequence by using a mask value to skip timesteps.

## Description
For each timestep in the input tensor (dimension #1 in the tensor), if all values in the input tensor at that timestep are equal to `mask_value`, then the timestep will be masked (skipped) in all downstream layers (as long as they support masking). If any downstream layer does not support masking yet receives such an input mask, an exception will be raised. 


## Usage
```r
layer_masking( 
  object, 
  mask_value = 0, 
  input_shape = NULL, 
  batch_input_shape = NULL, 
  batch_size = NULL, 
  dtype = NULL, 
  name = NULL, 
  trainable = NULL, 
  weights = NULL 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| object | What to compose the new `Layer` instance with. Typically a Sequential model or a Tensor (e.g., as returned by `layer_input()`). The return value depends on `object`. If `object` is: <br>- missing or `NULL`, the `Layer` instance is returned. <br>- a `Sequential` model, the model with an additional layer is returned. <br>- a Tensor, the output tensor from `layer_instance(object)` is returned.  |
| mask_value | float, mask value |
| input_shape | Dimensionality of the input (integer) not including the samples axis. This argument is required when using this layer as the first layer in a model. |
| batch_input_shape | Shapes, including the batch size. For instance, `batch_input_shape=c(10, 32)` indicates that the expected input will be batches of 10 32-dimensional vectors. `batch_input_shape=list(NULL, 32)`<br>indicates batches of an arbitrary number of 32-dimensional vectors. |
| batch_size | Fixed batch size for layer |
| dtype | The data type expected by the input, as a string (`float32`, `float64`, `int32`...) |
| name | An optional name string for the layer. Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice). It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided. |
| trainable | Whether the layer weights will be updated during training. |
| weights | Initial weights for layer. |
