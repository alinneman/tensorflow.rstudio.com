## Plot training history

## Description
 Plots metrics recorded during training. 


## Usage
```r
 
## S3 method for class 'keras_training_history'
plot( 
  x, 
  y, 
  metrics = NULL, 
  method = c("auto", "ggplot2", "base"), 
  smooth = getOption("keras.plot.history.smooth", TRUE), 
  theme_bw = getOption("keras.plot.history.theme_bw", FALSE), 
  ... 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| x | Training history object returned from `fit.keras.engine.training.Model()`. |
| y | Unused. |
| metrics | One or more metrics to plot (e.g. `c('loss', 'accuracy')`). Defaults to plotting all captured metrics. |
| method | Method to use for plotting. The default "auto" will use `ggplot2` if available, and otherwise will use base graphics. |
| smooth | Whether a loess smooth should be added to the plot, only available for the `ggplot2` method. If the number of epochs is smaller than ten, it is forced to false. |
