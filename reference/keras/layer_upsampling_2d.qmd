# layer_upsampling_2d

## Upsampling layer for 2D inputs.

## Description
Repeats the rows and columns of the data by `size[[0]]` and `size[[1]]` respectively. 


## Usage
```r
layer_upsampling_2d( 
  object, 
  size = c(2L, 2L), 
  data_format = NULL, 
  interpolation = "nearest", 
  batch_size = NULL, 
  name = NULL, 
  trainable = NULL, 
  weights = NULL 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| object | What to compose the new `Layer` instance with. Typically a Sequential model or a Tensor (e.g., as returned by `layer_input()`). The return value depends on `object`. If `object` is: <br>- missing or `NULL`, the `Layer` instance is returned. <br>- a `Sequential` model, the model with an additional layer is returned. <br>- a Tensor, the output tensor from `layer_instance(object)` is returned.  |
| size | int, or list of 2 integers. The upsampling factors for rows and columns. |
| data_format | A string, one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, height, width, channels)` while `channels_first` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, channels, height, width)`. It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`. If you never set it, then it will be "channels_last". |
| interpolation | A string, one of `nearest` or `bilinear`. Note that CNTK does not support yet the `bilinear` upscaling and that with Theano, only `size=(2, 2)` is possible. |
| batch_size | Fixed batch size for layer |
| name | An optional name string for the layer. Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice). It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided. |
| trainable | Whether the layer weights will be updated during training. |
| weights | Initial weights for layer. |


## Section

## Input shape

4D tensor with shape: 

- If `data_format` is `"channels_last"`: `(batch, rows, cols, channels)`

- If `data_format` is `"channels_first"`: `(batch, channels, rows, cols)`

## Output shape

4D tensor with shape: 

- If `data_format` is `"channels_last"`: `(batch, upsampled_rows, upsampled_cols, channels)`

- If `data_format` is `"channels_first"`: `(batch, channels, upsampled_rows, upsampled_cols)`
