# layer_minimum

## Layer that computes the minimum (element-wise) a list of inputs.

## Description
 It takes as input a list of tensors, all of the same shape, and returns a single tensor (also of the same shape). 


## Usage
```r
 
layer_minimum(inputs, ...) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| inputs | A input tensor, or list of input tensors. Can be missing. |
| ... | Unnamed args are treated as additional `inputs`. Named arguments are passed on as standard layer arguments. |



## Value
 A tensor, the element-wise maximum of the inputs. If `inputs` is missing, a keras layer instance is returned.
