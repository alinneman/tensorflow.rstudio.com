# k_dropout

## Sets entries in `x` to zero at random, while scaling the entire tensor.

## Description
 Sets entries in `x` to zero at random, while scaling the entire tensor. 


## Usage
```r
 
k_dropout(x, level, noise_shape = NULL, seed = NULL) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| x | tensor |
| level | fraction of the entries in the tensor that will be set to 0. |
| noise_shape | shape for randomly generated keep/drop flags, must be broadcastable to the shape of `x` |
| seed | random seed to ensure determinism. |

## Keras Backend

   This function is part of a set of Keras backend functions that enable lower level access to the core operations of the backend tensor engine (e.g. TensorFlow, CNTK, Theano, etc.).  You can see a list of all available backend functions here: [https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/backend.html#backend-functions](https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/backend.html#backend-functions). 

## Value
 A tensor.
