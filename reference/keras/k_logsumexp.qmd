# k_logsumexp

## (Deprecated) Computes log(sum(exp(elements across dimensions of a tensor))).

## Description
This funciton is deprecated. Please use `tensorflow::tf$reduce_logsumexp()`. 


## Usage
```r
k_logsumexp(x, axis = NULL, keepdims = FALSE) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| x | A tensor or variable. |
| axis | An integer, the axis to reduce over (axis indexes are 1-based). |
| keepdims | A boolean, whether to keep the dimensions or not. If `keepdims` is `FALSE`, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1. If `keepdims` is `TRUE`, the reduced dimension is retained with length 1. |

## Details
This function is more numerically stable than log(sum(exp(x))). It avoids overflows caused by taking the exp of large inputs and underflows caused by taking the log of small inputs. 

## Section

## Keras Backend

This function is part of a set of Keras backend functions that enable lower level access to the core operations of the backend tensor engine (e.g. TensorFlow, CNTK, Theano, etc.). 

You can see a list of all available backend functions here: [https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/backend.html#backend-functions](https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/backend.html#backend-functions). 

## Value
The reduced tensor.
