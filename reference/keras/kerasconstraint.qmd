# KerasConstraint

## (Deprecated) Base R6 class for Keras constraints

## Description
 New custom constraints are encouraged to subclass `keras$constraints$Constraint` directly. 

## Format
 An R6Class generator object 



## Details
 You can implement a custom constraint either by creating an R function that accepts a weights (`w`) parameter, or by creating an R6 class that derives from `KerasConstraint` and implements a `call` method. 

## Section

## Methods

   

`call(w)`

Constrain the specified weights.

  


## Note
 Models which use custom constraints cannot be serialized using `save_model_hdf5()`. Rather, the weights of the model should be saved and restored using `save_model_weights_hdf5()`. 

## Examples
```{r, eval=ecodown::examples_not_run()}
library(keras)
 
CustomNonNegConstraint <- R6::R6Class( 
  "CustomNonNegConstraint", 
  inherit = KerasConstraint, 
  public = list( 
    call = function(x) { 
       w * k_cast(k_greater_equal(w, 0), k_floatx()) 
    } 
  ) 
) 
 
layer_dense(units = 32, input_shape = c(784), 
            kernel_constraint = CustomNonNegConstraint$new()) 
 
 
```
