# layer_global_max_pooling_1d

## Global max pooling operation for temporal data.

## Description
Global max pooling operation for temporal data. 


## Usage
```r
layer_global_max_pooling_1d( 
  object, 
  data_format = "channels_last", 
  keepdims = FALSE, 
  ... 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| object | What to compose the new `Layer` instance with. Typically a Sequential model or a Tensor (e.g., as returned by `layer_input()`). The return value depends on `object`. If `object` is: <br>- missing or `NULL`, the `Layer` instance is returned. <br>- a `Sequential` model, the model with an additional layer is returned. <br>- a Tensor, the output tensor from `layer_instance(object)` is returned.  |
| data_format | One of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. |
| keepdims | A boolean, whether to keep the spatial dimensions or not. If `keepdims` is `FALSE` (default), the rank of the tensor is reduced for spatial dimensions. If `keepdims` is `TRUE`, the spatial dimensions are retained with length 1. The behavior is the same as for `tf.reduce_mean` or `np.mean`. |
| ... | standard layer arguments. |
