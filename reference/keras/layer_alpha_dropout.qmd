# layer_alpha_dropout

## Applies Alpha Dropout to the input.

## Description
Alpha Dropout is a dropout that keeps mean and variance of inputs to their original values, in order to ensure the self-normalizing property even after this dropout. 


## Usage
```r
layer_alpha_dropout(object, rate, noise_shape = NULL, seed = NULL, ...) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| object | What to compose the new `Layer` instance with. Typically a Sequential model or a Tensor (e.g., as returned by `layer_input()`). The return value depends on `object`. If `object` is: <br>- missing or `NULL`, the `Layer` instance is returned. <br>- a `Sequential` model, the model with an additional layer is returned. <br>- a Tensor, the output tensor from `layer_instance(object)` is returned.  |
| rate | float, drop probability (as with `layer_dropout()`). The multiplicative noise will have standard deviation `sqrt(rate / (1 - rate))`. |
| noise_shape | Noise shape |
| seed | An integer to use as random seed. |
| ... | standard layer arguments. |

## Details
Alpha Dropout fits well to Scaled Exponential Linear Units by randomly setting activations to the negative saturation value. 

## Section

## Input shape

 Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape` (list of integers, does not include the samples axis) when using this layer as the first layer in a model. 

## Output shape

 Same shape as input.
