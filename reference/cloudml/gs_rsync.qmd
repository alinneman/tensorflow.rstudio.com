# gs_rsync

## Synchronize content of two buckets/directories

## Description
The `gs_rsync` function makes the contents under `destination` the same as the contents under `source`, by copying any missing files/objects (or those whose data has changed), and (if the `delete` option is specified) deleting any extra files/objects. `source` must specify a directory, bucket, or bucket subdirectory. 


## Usage
```r
gs_rsync(source, destination, delete = FALSE, recursive = FALSE, 
  parallel = TRUE, dry_run = FALSE, options = NULL, echo = TRUE) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| source | The file to be copied. This can be either a path on the local filesystem, or a Google Storage URI (e.g. `gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/[FILENAME.CSV]`). |
| destination | The location where the `source` file should be copied to. This can be either a path on the local filesystem, or a Google Storage URI (e.g. `gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/[FILENAME.CSV]`). |
| delete | Delete extra files under `destination` not found under `source` By default extra files are not deleted. |
| recursive | Causes directories, buckets, and bucket subdirectories to be synchronized recursively. If you neglect to use this option `gs_rsync()` will make only the top-level directory in the source and destination URLs match, skipping any sub-directories. |
| parallel | Causes synchronization to run in parallel. This can significantly improve performance if you are performing operations on a large number of files over a reasonably fast network connection. |
| dry_run | Causes rsync to run in "dry run" mode, i.e., just outputting what would be copied or deleted without actually doing any copying/deleting. |
| options | Character vector of additional command line options to the gsutil rsync command (as specified at [https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/rsync](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/rsync)). |
| echo | Echo command output to console. |
