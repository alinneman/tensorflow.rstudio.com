# cloudml-package

## Interface to the Google Cloud Machine Learning Platform

## Description

The **cloudml** package provides an R interface to [Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/), a managed service that enables: 

- Scalable training of models built with the [keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/), [tfestimators](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators), and [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/) R packages. 

- On-demand access to training on GPUs, including the new [Tesla P100 GPUs](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-p100.html) from NVIDIAÂ®. 

- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize key attributes of model architectures in order to maximize predictive accuracy. 

- Deployment of trained models to the Google global prediction platform that can support thousands of users and TBs of data. 




## Details

CloudML is a managed service where you pay only for the hardware resources that you use. Prices vary depending on configuration (e.g. CPU vs. GPU vs. multiple GPUs). See [https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/pricing](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/pricing) for additional details. 

For documentation on using the R interface to CloudML see the package website at [https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/cloudml/](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/cloudml/)
