# hub_sparse_text_embedding_column

## Module to construct dense representations from sparse text features.

## Description
The input to this feature column is a batch of multiple strings with arbitrary size, assuming the input is a SparseTensor. 


## Usage
```r
hub_sparse_text_embedding_column( 
  key, 
  module_spec, 
  combiner, 
  default_value, 
  trainable = FALSE 
) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| key | A string or [feature_column](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators/articles/feature_columns.html) identifying the text feature. |
| module_spec | A string handle or a _ModuleSpec identifying the module. |
| combiner | a string specifying reducing op for embeddings in the same Example. Currently, 'mean', 'sqrtn', 'sum' are supported. Using `combiner = NULL` is undefined. |
| default_value | default value for Examples where the text feature is empty. Note, it's recommended to have default_value consistent OOV tokens, in case there was special handling of OOV in the text module. If `NULL`, the text feature is assumed be non-empty for each Example. |
| trainable | Whether or not the Module is trainable. `FALSE` by default, meaning the pre-trained weights are frozen. This is different from the ordinary `tf.feature_column.embedding_column()`, but that one is intended for training from scratch. |

## Details

This type of feature column is typically suited for modules that operate on pre-tokenized text to produce token level embeddings which are combined with the combiner into a text embedding. The combiner always treats the tokens  as a bag of words rather than a sequence. 

The output (i.e., transformed input layer) is a DenseTensor, with shape [batch_size, num_embedding_dim].
