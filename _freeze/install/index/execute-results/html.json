Below we describe how to install TensorFlow as well the various\noptions available for customizing your installation.\n\nNote that this article principally covers the use of the R `install_tensorflow()` function,\nwhich provides an easy to use wrapper for the various steps required to install\nTensorFlow.\n\nYou can also choose to install TensorFlow manually (as described at <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/>). In that case the [Custom Installation](/installation/custom) section\ncovers how to arrange for the tensorflow R package to use the version you installed.\n\nTensorFlow is tested and supported on the following 64-bit systems:\n\n- Ubuntu 16.04 or later\n- Windows 7 or later\n- macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later (no GPU support)\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, install the tensorflow R package from GitHub as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tensorflow\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, configure R (reticulate) with a Python installation it can use, like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(reticulate)\npath_to_python <- install_python()\nvirtualenv_create(\"r-reticulate\", python = path_to_python)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThen, use the `install_tensorflow()` function to install TensorFlow.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tensorflow)\ninstall_tensorflow(envname = \"r-reticulate\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can confirm that the installation succeeded with:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tensorflow)\ntf$constant(\"Hello Tensorflow\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoaded Tensorflow version 2.9.1\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ntf.Tensor(b'Hello Tensorflow', shape=(), dtype=string)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis will provide you with a default installation of TensorFlow suitable for use\nwith the tensorflow R package. Read on if you want to learn about additional installation options, including installing a version of TensorFlow that takes advantage of Nvidia GPUs if you have the correct CUDA libraries installed.\n\n## Installation methods\n\nTensorFlow is distributed as a Python package and so needs to be installed within a Python environment on your system. By default, the `install_tensorflow()` function attempts to install TensorFlow within an isolated Python environment (\"r-reticulate\").\n\nThese are the available methods and their behavior:\n\n| Method  | Description  |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| auto  | Automatically choose an appropriate default for the current platform. |\n| virtualenv  | Install into a Python virtual environment at `~/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate` |\n| conda  | Install into an Anaconda Python environment named `r-reticulate` |\n| system  | Install into the system Python environment  |\n\n\n`install_tensorflow` is a wrapper around `reticulate::py_install`. Please refer to ['Installing Python Packages'](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html) for more information.\n\n## Alternate Versions\n\nBy default, `install_tensorflow()` install the latest release version of TensorFlow. You can override this behavior by specifying the `version` parameter. For example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall_tensorflow(version = \"2.7\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that you can provide a full `major.minor.patch` version specification, or just a `major.minor` specification, in which case the latest patch is automatically selected.\n\nYou can install the nightly build of TensorFlow (CPU or GPU version) with:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall_tensorflow(version = \"nightly\")      # cpu+gpu version\ninstall_tensorflow(version = \"nightly-cpu\")  # cpu version\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can install any other build of TensorFlow by specifying a URL to a TensorFlow binary. For example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall_tensorflow(version = \"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/c2/c1/a035e377cf5a5b90eff27f096448fa5c5a90cbcf13b7eb0673df888f2c2d/tf_nightly-1.12.0.dev20180918-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl\")\n```\n:::\n",
