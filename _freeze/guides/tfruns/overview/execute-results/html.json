These packages can be installed with:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"keras\")\ninstall.packages(\"tfestimators\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Training\n\nIn the following sections we'll describe the various capabilities of **tfruns**. Our example training script ([mnist_mlp.R](https://github.com/rstudio/tfruns/blob/main/inst/examples/mnist_mlp/mnist_mlp.R)) trains a Keras model to recognize MNIST digits.\n\nTo train a model with **tfruns**, just use the `training_run()` function in place of the `source()` function to execute your R script. For example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tfruns)\ntraining_run(\"mnist_mlp.R\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen training is completed, a summary of the run will automatically be displayed if you are within an interactive R session:\n\n<kbd><img src=\"images/view_run.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;\" width=675/></kbd>\n\nThe metrics and output of each run are automatically captured within a *run directory* which is unique for each run that you initiate. Note that for Keras and TF Estimator models this data is captured automatically (no changes to your source code are required).\n\nYou can call the `latest_run()` function to view the results of the last run (including the path to the run directory which stores all of the run's output):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlatest_run()\n```\n:::\n\n```\n$ run_dir           : chr \"runs/2017-10-02T14-23-38Z\"\n$ eval_loss         : num 0.0956\n$ eval_acc          : num 0.98\n$ metric_loss       : num 0.0624\n$ metric_acc        : num 0.984\n$ metric_val_loss   : num 0.0962\n$ metric_val_acc    : num 0.98\n$ flag_dropout1     : num 0.4\n$ flag_dropout2     : num 0.3\n$ samples           : int 48000\n$ validation_samples: int 12000\n$ batch_size        : int 128\n$ epochs            : int 20\n$ epochs_completed  : int 20\n$ metrics           : chr \"(metrics data frame)\"\n$ model             : chr \"(model summary)\"\n$ loss_function     : chr \"categorical_crossentropy\"\n$ optimizer         : chr \"RMSprop\"\n$ learning_rate     : num 0.001\n$ script            : chr \"mnist_mlp.R\"\n$ start             : POSIXct[1:1], format: \"2017-10-02 14:23:38\"\n$ end               : POSIXct[1:1], format: \"2017-10-02 14:24:24\"\n$ completed         : logi TRUE\n$ output            : chr \"(script ouptut)\"\n$ source_code       : chr \"(source archive)\"\n$ context           : chr \"local\"\n$ type              : chr \"training\"\n```\n\nThe run directory used in the example above is \"runs/2017-10-02T14-23-38Z\". Run directories are by default generated within the \"runs\" subdirectory of the current working directory, and use a timestamp as the name of the run directory. You can view the report for any given run using the `view_run()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nview_run(\"runs/2017-10-02T14-23-38Z\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Comparing Runs\n\nLet's make a couple of changes to our training script to see if we can improve model performance. We'll change the number of units in our first dense layer to 128, change the `learning_rate` from 0.001 to 0.003 and run 30 rather than 20 `epochs`. After making these changes to the source code we re-run the script using `training_run()` as before:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntraining_run(\"mnist_mlp.R\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis will also show us a report summarizing the results of the run, but what we are really interested in is a comparison between this run and the previous one. We can view a comparison via the `compare_runs()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncompare_runs()\n```\n:::\n\n\n<kbd><img src=\"images/compare_runs.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;\" width=675/></kbd>\n\nThe comparison report shows the model attributes and metrics side-by-side, as well as differences in the source code and output of the training script.\n\nNote that `compare_runs()` will by default compare the last two runs, however you can pass any two run directories you like to be compared.\n\n## Analyzing Runs\n\nWe've demonstrated visualizing and comparing one or two runs, however as you accumulate more runs you'll generally want to analyze and compare runs many runs. You can use the `ls_runs()` function to yield a data frame with summary information on all of the runs you've conducted within a given directory:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nls_runs()\n```\n:::\n\n```\nData frame: 4 x 28\n                    run_dir eval_loss eval_acc metric_loss metric_acc metric_val_loss metric_val_acc\n1 runs/2017-12-09T21-01-11Z    0.1485   0.9562      0.2577     0.9240          0.1482         0.9545\n2 runs/2017-12-09T21-00-11Z    0.1438   0.9573      0.2655     0.9208          0.1505         0.9559\n3 runs/2017-12-09T19-59-44Z    0.1407   0.9580      0.2597     0.9241          0.1402         0.9578\n4 runs/2017-12-09T19-56-48Z    0.1437   0.9555      0.2610     0.9227          0.1459         0.9551\n# ... with 21 more columns:\n#   flag_batch_size, flag_dropout1, flag_dropout2, samples, validation_samples, batch_size,\n#   epochs, epochs_completed, metrics, model, loss_function, optimizer, learning_rate, script,\n#   start, end, completed, output, source_code, context, type\n```\n\nYou can also render a sortable, filterable version all of the columns within RStudio using the `View()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nView(ls_runs())\n```\n:::\n\n\n<kbd><img src=\"images/ls_runs_rstudio.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;\" width=675/></kbd>\n\nThe `ls_runs()` function also supports `subset` and `order` arguments. For example, the following will yield all runs with an eval accuracy better than 0.98:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nls_runs(eval_acc > 0.9570, order = eval_acc)\n```\n:::\n\n```\nData frame: 2 x 28\n                    run_dir eval_acc eval_loss metric_loss metric_acc metric_val_loss metric_val_acc\n1 runs/2017-12-09T19-59-44Z   0.9580    0.1407      0.2597     0.9241          0.1402         0.9578\n2 runs/2017-12-09T21-00-11Z   0.9573    0.1438      0.2655     0.9208          0.1505         0.9559\n# ... with 21 more columns:\n#   flag_batch_size, flag_dropout1, flag_dropout2, samples, validation_samples, batch_size,\n#   epochs, epochs_completed, metrics, model, loss_function, optimizer, learning_rate, script,\n#   start, end, completed, output, source_code, context, type\n```\n\nYou can pass the results of `ls_runs()` to compare runs (which will always compare the first two runs passed). For example, this will compare the two runs that performed best in terms of evaluation accuracy:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncompare_runs(ls_runs(eval_acc > 0.9570, order = eval_acc))\n```\n:::\n\n\n<kbd><img src=\"images/ls_runs_compare.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;\" width=675/></kbd>\n\n## RStudio IDE\n\nIf you use RStudio with **tfruns**, it's strongly recommended that you use RStudio v1.1 or higher, as there are are a number of points of integration with the IDE that require this newer releases.\n\n### Addin\n\nThe **tfruns** package installs an RStudio IDE addin which provides quick access to frequently used functions from the Addins menu:\n\n<kbd><img src=\"images/rstudio_addin.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;\" width=675/></kbd>\n\nNote that you can use **Tools** -> **Modify Keyboard Shortcuts** within RStudio to assign a keyboard shortcut to one or more of the addin commands.\n\n### Background Training\n\nRStudio v1.1 includes a Terminal pane alongside the Console pane. Since training runs can become quite lengthy, it's often useful to run them in the background in order to keep the R console free for other work. You can do this from a Terminal as follows:\n\n<kbd><img src=\"images/rstudio_terminal.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;\" width=675/></kbd>\n\nIf you are not running within RStudio then you can of course use a system terminal window for background training.\n\n### Publishing Reports\n\nTraining run views and comparisons are HTML documents which can be saved and shared with others. When viewing a report within RStudio v1.1 you can save a copy of the report or publish it to RPubs or RStudio Connect:\n\n<kbd><img src=\"images/rstudio_publish.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;\" width=675/></kbd>\n\nIf you are not running within RStudio then you can use the `save_run_view()` and `save_run_comparison()` functions to create standalone HTML versions of run reports.\n\n\n## Hyperparameter Tuning\n\nTuning a model often requires exploring the impact of changes to many hyperparameters. The best way to approach this is generally to systematically train over the combinations of those parameters to determine which combination yields the best model. See the [Hyperparmeter Tuning](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/tfruns/articles/tuning.html) article for details on how to accomplish this with tfruns.\n\n## Managing Runs\n\nThere are a variety of tools available for managing training run output, including:\n\n1) Exporting run artifacts (e.g. saved models).\n\n2) Copying and purging run directories.\n\n3) Using a custom run directory for an experiment or other set of related runs.\n\nThe [Managing Runs](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/tfruns/articles/managing.html) article provides additional details on using these features.",
