When loading saved models that use these functions you typically need to explicitily map names to user objects via the `custom_objects` parmaeter.  The `with_custom_object_scope()` function provides an alternative that lets you create a named alias for a user object that applies to an entire block of code, and is automatically recognized when loading saved models. \n\n\n\n\n## Examples\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(keras)\n \n# define custom metric \nmetric_top_3_categorical_accuracy <- \n  custom_metric(\"top_3_categorical_accuracy\", function(y_true, y_pred) { \n    metric_top_k_categorical_accuracy(y_true, y_pred, k = 3) \n  }) \n \nwith_custom_object_scope(c(top_k_acc = sparse_top_k_cat_acc), { \n \n  # ...define model... \n \n  # compile model (refer to \"top_k_acc\" by name) \n  model %>% compile( \n    loss = \"binary_crossentropy\", \n    optimizer = optimizer_nadam(), \n    metrics = c(\"top_k_acc\") \n  ) \n \n  # save the model \n  save_model_hdf5(\"my_model.h5\") \n \n  # loading the model within the custom object scope doesn't \n  # require explicitly providing the custom_object \n  load_model_hdf5(\"my_model.h5\") \n}) \n```\n:::\n",
