The step will be added to the sequence of operations for this recipe. |\n| ... | One or more selector functions to choose variables. |\n| role | Role for the created variables |\n| trained | A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have been estimated. |\n| handle | the Module handle to resolve. |\n| args | other arguments passed to [hub_load()]. |\n| skip | A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked by [recipes::bake.recipe()]? While all operations are baked when [recipes::prep.recipe()] is run, some operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using `skip = TRUE` as it may affect the computations for subsequent operations |\n| id | A character string that is unique to this step to identify it. |\n\n\n\n\n\n## Examples\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tfhub)\n \nlibrary(tibble) \nlibrary(recipes) \ndf <- tibble(text = c('hi', \"heello\", \"goodbye\"), y = 0) \n \nrec <- recipe(y ~ text, df) \nrec <- rec %>% step_pretrained_text_embedding( \n text, \n handle = \"https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/gnews-swivel-20dim-with-oov/1\" \n) \n```\n:::\n",
