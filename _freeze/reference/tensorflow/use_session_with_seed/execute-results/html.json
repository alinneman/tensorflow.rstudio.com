The provided `seed` value will establish a new random seed for R, Python, NumPy, and TensorFlow. GPU computations and CPU parallelism will also be disabled by default. \n\n\n## Usage\n```r\nuse_session_with_seed( \n  seed, \n  disable_gpu = TRUE, \n  disable_parallel_cpu = TRUE, \n  quiet = FALSE \n) \n```\n\n## Arguments\n|Arguments|Description|\n|---|---|\n| seed | A single value, interpreted as an integer |\n| disable_gpu | `TRUE` to disable GPU execution (see **Parallelism** below). |\n| disable_parallel_cpu | `TRUE` to disable CPU parallelism (see **Parallelism** below). |\n| quiet | `TRUE` to suppress printing of messages. |\n\n## Details\n\nThis function must be called at the very top of your script (i.e. immediately after `library(tensorflow)`, `library(keras)`, etc.). Any existing TensorFlow session is torn down via `tf$reset_default_graph()`. \n\nThis function takes all measures known to promote reproducible results from TensorFlow sessions, however it's possible that various individual TensorFlow features or dependent libraries escape its effects. If you encounter non-reproducible results please investigate the possible sources of the problem, contributions via pull request are very welcome! \n\nPackages which need to be notified before and after the seed is set can register for the \"tensorflow.on_before_use_session\" and \"tensorflow.on_use_session\" hooks (see `setHook()`) for additional details on hooks). \n\n## Section\n\n## Parallelism\n\n By default the `use_session_with_seed()` function disables GPU and CPU parallelism, since both can result in non-deterministic execution patterns (see [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42022950/](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42022950/)). You can optionally enable GPU or CPU parallelism by setting the `disable_gpu` and/or `disable_parallel_cpu` parameters to `FALSE`. \n\n## Value\nTensorFlow session object, invisibly \n\n\n## Examples\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tensorflow) \nuse_session_with_seed(42) \n```\n:::\n",
